## Theoretical Link between <br> Deliberation and Regime Legitimacy 


---

## Theory

+ Central claim of deliberative theory: 
    + making it possible to arrive at (more) legitimate desicions


--
+ Conceptualization of legitimacy as regime support 


--
+ General assumption: Deliberative qualities of a political system increase support from its citizens


--
+ *Authoritarian deliberation*: Might decrease support due to increasing democratic capabilites

## Data & Methodology


---

#### Data & Methodology

**Individual-Level Data**
+ Merging of the following datasets: 
  + Afrobarometer Survey, Round 5 and Round 6 (data from 2011-2015)  
  + Asian Barometer Survey, Wave 3 and Wave 4 (2010-2015) 
  + AmericasBarometer (2010-2014) 
  + European Social Survey, Round 6 (2012) 
  + Latinobar√≥metro (2015) 
  + World Values Survey (2010-2014)

+ In total 316,938 individual cases in 119 Countries
  + weighted to same sample size (=1000)


--

**Country-Level Data**
+ "Varieties of Democracy"-Dataset: Deliberative Component Index
+ Control variables come from V-Dem and the QoG-Dataset
+ Lagging of Independent Variables (Averaging from 2000 - 2010)

#### Data & Methodology

.ninetyfive[

+ Control Variables
    + Micro Level
        + Age
        + Sex (Male/Female)
        + Financial Security
        + Education
        + Employment (0/1)
    + Macro Level
        + Polity/FH
        + Democracy (0/1)
        + Autocracy (0/1)
        + logged GDP per capita
        + logged Population
        + Life Expectancy
        + Urban Pop. Ratio
    + Survey dummies
        + WVS, Afrobarometer, Latinobarometro, Americasbarometer, Asianbarometer, ESS

## Operationalization of Regime Support

Three types of traditional political branches
+ executive (political leadership)
+ judicial and legal system (courts and police)
+ legislation (parliament) 


```{r}
htmltools::includeHTML("tables/factor_analysis.html")
```

## Deliberative Component Index (DCI)?

+ short description?
+ Table with five components?

## Challenges

*Two major challenges emerged:*

+ Colinearity between Deliberation indicators and Democracy Measures

--

+ Possibly biased self-reported regime support 

--

#### Multicolinearity issue

#### Correlation between DCI and Polity/FH

## Analysis & Results

---

## Analysis

+ Multilevel Models
    + In total 91 seperate models
    + DVs: Regime Support (No, Low, High Bias)
    + Main IVs: All six Deliberation indicators

## Conclusions & Future Research

---

## Conclusions & Future Research

* No simple answer to research question
 + deliberation seems to have a positive effect on regime support in democracies
 + less robust and ambiguous results for non-democracies and complete sample
    
    
* Presumably biased regime support
 + should be taken into account 
 + possible remedies? (e.g. weighting procedures, survey design)

* Validity of the DCI
    + more sensitive approaches to measure deliberation on the country level are neccessary
    + nevertheless interesting differences regarding the subsamples
